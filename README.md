#### My Ethical Principles

*"Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is right to do"* -Potter Stewart

#### **Ethics Definition** - *Moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity.*

#### **Moral Definition** - *A person's standards of behavior or beliefs concerning what is and is not acceptable for them to do.*

### 5 Rules to go by:

### <u>1. No means No</u>

In the world of data, that data is collected from somewhere. Often times it is from a end user on a platform. It is vitially important to get the users consent before collecting data. Not doing so can create a legal obligation to your company and can break the trust of your users and customers. 

### <u>2. What are your intentions with my Data?</u>

When collecting data and building models it is important to not only be intentional with the purpose of the project, but for that intention to be good. An example of good intentions would be collecting a users spending data to have them budget, while a bad intention would be using their consumption data to serve them adds for things they currently buying to increase their spending. 

### <u>3. Comunication is key</u>

If data is going to be collected from a user, not only does the user need to give consent, but the user needs to be able to know how their data will be used. To fully give consent to data collection  a user must also know how their data will be used. If their data is used to create programs that can profile people for a social credit score, they might not want to consent to that. Now if they are collecting the data to create a better user expirence for them, they might want to contribute their data to them for that.

### <u>4. Don't Cheat on your Data</u>

Often times when working on a project, a Data Scientist is working to a desired outcome. Now there is a problem when that is not the outcome that reached. There is a temptation to alter, change or manipulate data into a form that will yield the desired result. It is important to never do this as a Data Scientist because it is not only wrong to fake data, but it will not continue yield the desired results over time. 

### <u>5. It only takes once to loose trust</u>

Trust is one of the most important things that a person or a company can have. It is also very expensive becuase it can take years to build trust with person or as a brand. While working with statistical models it can be very easy to make a mistake that can loose trust within a company or from customers. This is why it is extremely important to have the systems in place to verify that mistakes will not be made where it can cost you, your team or your company to loose that trust. 

## Reading Discussion

### The Car Insurance Industry Attacks Our Story. Here’s Our Response.

I found this article to be particluarly interesting because it is disputing a the claim that a previous article of theirs was false about car insurnce claims and rates being disportionate in minority neighborhoods. This is important for a couple if reasons, the first. being how they approached and presented the first aritcle. The company was attacking what they believe to be their method in arriving at their results, however this was false. They had used a different method/model to arrive at those results. This shows how important it is to clearly comunicate how one arives at results and speak to the validity of a model or statistical analysis. 

### Physiognomy’s New Clothes

I really liked this article because it brought past assumptions of humans into the present, and applying them to new technologies such as Machaine LEarning and AI. It just goes to show how the auumptions of one person can go on to affect so many dependent on whether or not they are correct. It also shows just how important it is to throughly think through the affects of a model before implementing it. 

### The Friendship That Made Google Huge

This story resonates with becuase of the effort that they put in to master their craft and build something truly great. They were only able to fix the problem at. google because they spent hunderds, if not thousands, of hours working towards a solution. It was thorugh this hard wrok that they were bale to build a solution that lead to changing the internet through their pwerful search engine and reslient method to contructing serves.
